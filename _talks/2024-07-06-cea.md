Half-day tutorial as part of the CEA event <strong>
Parallel IO and in situ analytics: High-performance data handling @ Exascale </strong>
that showcases the must-know tools for high-performance input-output on supercomputers and discover the latest tools for in situ data analytics. The event included presentation for ADIOS, HDF, NetCDF and PDI and interactions with developers of the leading tools in their category as well as IO administrators of the top French national super-computing facility.

The ADIOS half-day tutorial demonstrated how applications can achieve high performance at scale for streaming and file-based workflows. Advanced features have been demoed to showcase how these tools can be used over the WAN to allow a client running at one location to access remote data for analyzing and visualizing the data locally as well as how to incorporate compression into the workflow.

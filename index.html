<h3 id="about-me"> About me </h3>

<p>
I am a Reseach Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department of Vanderbilt University. Previously, 
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign while holding a research assistanship with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications funded by the Blue Waters  project.
<br /><br />


My research interests are in the broad area of <i>performance optimization and resiliency</i> for High Performance Computing, Clouds and distributed computing systems and applications. My research focuses on designing new runtime systems (including <i>scheduling policies, I/O middleware, fault tolerance mechanisms and resource sharing policies</i>) as well as analyzing and optimizing algorithms.
<br /><br />

More recent, I have started working on computational data science in HPC, with a special focus on irregular applications. I am interested in understanding the computational needs of emerging new fields that do not follow the traditional HPC/Cloud models (like neuroscience and bioinformatics). Data-intensive computing and the HPC/Big-Data/Machine Learning convergence are also topics of interest.
<br /><br />

Feel free to check out my work and if you have any questions, or would like to work together, don't hesitate to contact me.

<h3 id="funding" class>Funding opportunities</h2>
<p>
Funding available for a graduate student in the <a href="http://scl.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/">Scalable Computing Laboratory</a> team. The general topic is performance analysis and optimization (either working at the runtime/middleware or at the application level) for HPC scientific applications (sparse graphs, deep learning codes or neurscience specific applications).

I had the pleasure of being invited to give a talk to the Scientific Machine Learning Research Group at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. My talk focuses on performance considerations and trade-offs of emerging AI workflows from the I/O sub-system perspective.

<p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">

<strong>Abstract:</strong>

Scientific applications are currently increasing the use of surrogate models to replace expensive kernels and are including digital twins in their simulations. This creates complex workflows which have a mixture of I/O from different components: simulation, AI models, and analytics and which often require conflicting optimizations. In this talk, we will take a look at the performance of a few anticipated AI workflows and discuss ways of avoiding breaking the I/O subsystem during their deployment.

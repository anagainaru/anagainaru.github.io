<br/>Welcome to my website !!<br/><br/>

I am a Reseach Assitant Professor in the Computer Science Department of <strong>Vanderbilt University</strong> working in the <a href="http://scl.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/">Scalable Computing Laboratory</a> team. <br />
I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the <strong>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</strong> whie holding a research assistanship with the <strong>National Center for Supercomputing Applications</strong> funded by the Blue Waters  project.
<br /><br />


My research interests are in the broad area of <i>performance optmization and resiliency</i> for High Performance Computing, Clouds and distributed computing systems and applications. My research focuses on designing new runtime systems (including <i>scheduling policies, I/O middleware, fault tolerance mechanism and resource sharing policies</i>) as well as analyzing and optimizing algorithms.
<br /><br />

More recent, I have started working on computational data science in HPC, with a special focus on irregular applications. I am interested in understanding the computational needs of emerging new fields that do not follow the traditional HPC/Cloud models (like neuroscience and bioinformatics). Data-intensive computing and the HPC/Big-Data/Machine Learning convergence are also topics of interest.
<br /><br />

Feel free to check out my work and if you have any questions, or would like to work together, don't hesitate to contact me.

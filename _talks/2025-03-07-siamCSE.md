Machine learning proxy models offer a powerful approach to accelerating and even replacing computationally expensive models. However, constructing these digital twins presents a unique challenge in efficiently generating training data. A naive uniform sampling of the input space can lead to a non-uniform sampling of the output space, resulting in gaps in training data coverage and potentially compromising accuracy. While massive datasets could eventually fill these gaps, the computational burden of full-scale simulations can make this impractical. In this talk, we introduce a framework for adaptive data generation that leverages uncertainty estimation to identify regions requiring additional training data and re-triggering simulations to fill the identified gaps. Essentially, this approach steers large-scale simulations towards generating the necessary data for training digital twins iteratively and thus reduces the data needed to train accurate digital twins. We will demonstrate the challenges at training at scale and the effectiveness of such methods on both a simple one-dimensional function and a complex multidimensional physics model.

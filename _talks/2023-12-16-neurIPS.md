The first edition of the Workshop on Advancing Neural Network Training (WANT) held as part of thre NeurIPS workshop presents talk relevant to computationally efficient training, which covers both memory-related issues and scalability issues, scalability and resource optimization. My invited talk explores the performance trade-offs within the multilayer high-performance I/O systems under the strain of emerging AI applications (inluding deep neural networks and large language models).

<strong>Abstract:</strong>

In recent years, scientific computing workloads at HPC facilities have been undergoing a significant shift. While traditionally dominated by numerical simulations, these facilities are increasingly handling AI/ML applications for training and inference, processing and producing ever-increasing amounts of scientific data. Despite the focus on optimizing the execution of new AI/HPC workflows, little attention has been paid to the I/O runtime challenges they present. This talk aims to address that gap by analyzing these emerging trends from an I/O perspective. We will explore the performance of the multilayer high-performance I/O systems under the strain of these new workflows that combine traditional HPC techniques with AI interacting in new challenging ways.

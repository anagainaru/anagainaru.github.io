The ADIOS User Group Meeting was a one day event attended by users from the US and Europe and has included talks about success stories using ADIOS in extreme scale storage I/O, in situ data processing and/or code coupling, as well as their newest requirements and requests to the ADIOS team. In the second half of the day ADIOS developers presented latest features like campaign management, remote data access, and the design of schemas independent from file formats to gather ideas and feedback from the users.

My talk focused on the GPU backend and the queries engine.

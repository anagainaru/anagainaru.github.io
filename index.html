<h3 id="about-me"> About me </h3>

<p>
I am a Computer Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Previously, I held a possition in the Vanderbilt University as a research asssistant professor and I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign while holding a research assistanship with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications funded by the Blue Waters  project.
<br /><br />


My research interests are in the broad area of <i>performance optimization and resiliency</i> for High Performance Computing systems and applications. My research focuses on designing new runtime systems (including <i>scheduling policies, I/O middleware, fault tolerance mechanisms and resource sharing policies</i>) as well as analyzing and optimizing algorithms.
<br /><br />

More recent, I have started working on computational data science in HPC, with a special focus on irregular applications. I am interested in understanding the computational and I/O needs of emerging new fields that do not follow the traditional HPC/Cloud models (like neuroscience and bioinformatics). Data-intensive computing and the HPC/Big-Data/Machine Learning convergence are also topics of interest.
<br /><br />

Feel free to check out my work and if you have any questions, or would like to work together, don't hesitate to contact me.

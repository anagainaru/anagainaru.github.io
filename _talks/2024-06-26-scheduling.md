Scientific data analysis often involves complex queries across distributed datasets, requiring manipulation of multiple primary variables and generating derived data that needs to be handled efficiently, creating challenges for applications that need to parse many large datasets. We investigate in this talk the performance of different approaches where applications define derived variables as quantities of interest (QoIs) and offload the computation and transfer of these QoIs to the I/O library. We look at a detailed analysis of the performance-storage trade-offs associated with different solutions and showcase results for our study
on two large-scale datasets created from climate and combustion
simulations.

The submitted articles can either be short (4 pages) position papers, or long (8 pages) research papers. We especially encourage submissions that look into the convergence of the three focus domains - HPC, BD, and AI. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n  Resource-management and scheduling for converged infrastructure\n  Interoperability, interference mitigation, performance variability\n  Novel system architectures and programming models for converged infrastructure\n  Performance studies of converged infrastructure, performance portability and compatibility\n  Converged storage systems, malleable and reconfigurable runtimes and middleware\n  Hardware-software co-design and concertation\n  Identifying common building blocks, libraries, and functionality for HPC, BD, and AI/ML/DL\n  Convergence with the cloud, redefining elasticity and scalability for converged infrastructure\n  New classes of applications, applications at the boundary of HPC, Big Data, AI, Machine Learning, or Deep Learning, or combinations of, that fit best on converged infrastructure\n\n\n",

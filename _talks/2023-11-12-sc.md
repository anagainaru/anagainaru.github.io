<strong>Abstract:</strong>
In this tutorial, we present ADIOS-2 which allows for building in situ and file-based data processing workflows for extreme scale systems, including interactive, on-demand, in situ visualization of the data, and including performance profiling of the entire workflow. Half of this tutorial will be hands-on sessions, where we provide access to the software, and build together a complete MiniApp with in situ analytics and performance analysis that users can run on their laptop and supercomputers at large scale. We will show how ADIOS-2 is fully integrated into three popular visualization and performance tools: Jupyter Notebook, ParaView and TAU, creating a software ecosystem for in situ processing of both performance and scientific data.
